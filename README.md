# SPA Web App using .NET Core, TypeScript and Angular 2/4

This is a second attempt at working with Angular 2/4 framwork on the .NET core platform.
The original attempt can be seen in the [dotnetcore-ng2-ts](https://github.com/robzagora/dotnetcore-ng2-ts) repository which was created with manual configuration and as a result was a painful process and not the most optimal one.

This repository was generated via the angular 2 template provided out of the box using the dotnet CLI which was desired to take away most of the configuration required to even get the solution up and running.

Some potentially useful [notes](https://github.com/robzagora/netcore-ng4-ts/blob/master/Solution%20Items/steps%20for%20vs%202017%20and%20angular%202.txt) have been added to the Solution Items directory after spending hours on issues in relation to working with ng2.

* Angular 2/4 framework
* .NET Core 1.1 with SignalR using WebSockets
* [Material Design 2](https://github.com/angular/material2)
* Bearer authorization using JWT tokens 
* D3.js to experiment with graphs.
