# SPA Web App using .NET Core, TypeScript and Angular 2/4

This is a second attempt at getting a working Angular 2/4 web application on the .NET core platform.
The original attempt can be seen in the [dotnetcore-ng2-ts](https://github.com/robzagora/dotnetcore-ng2-ts) repository.

Some potentially useful [notes](https://github.com/robzagora/netcore-ng4-ts/blob/master/Solution%20Items/steps%20for%20vs%202017%20and%20angular%202.txt) have been added to the Solution Items directory.

* Angular 2/4 framework
* .NET Core 1.1 with SignalR using WebSockets
* [Material Design 2](https://github.com/angular/material2)
* Bearer authorization using JWT tokens
