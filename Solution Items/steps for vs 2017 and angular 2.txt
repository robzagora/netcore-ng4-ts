== Solution Setup End

== Important notes start

-- launchSettings.json

don't change environmentVariables array to custom values (experiment more with this)
because in my initial testing, the differnt key values didn't allow for updated content to be displayed on the browser

== Important notes end

== GIT Start

If adding existing files to solution don't appear in changes,
You need to open up the cmd in the same place where .csproj file is and run
"git add -u"

== GIT End
